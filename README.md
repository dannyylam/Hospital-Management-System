This is the main menu of the hospital management system. Here we have 3 different panels: Doctor, Patient, and Room. We can hit “Logout” to take us back to Login screen.

This is the GUI of the Doctor Details. Here we can hire a new doctor to the hospital, update an existing doctor’s information, or fire the doctor! Below is a table view of the doctor’s table.

This is the Patient Detail page where you can check in patients, update their info, check them out of the hospital, and prescribe the treatment.

For the “Doctor” combo box, there will be a list of the available doctors that are currently working in the hospital. When new doctors are hired, their name will be loaded into the combo box. Patients are then assigned a doctor (based on their problem and the doctor’s specialization).

**What I learned:**
I learned a lot during the process of this project. I learned how to many techniques of Object-Oriented Programming.
I also learned how to implement the JDBC API to connect the frontend and the backend of the application. 
One part I struggled a lot with was loading the table from MySQL 
to the JavaFX table, but I eventually figured it out and it was the best feeling ever.
I really enjoyed scripting the SQL queries on the backend for adding, updating, and deleting records from the 
Doctor and Patient tables, then seeing the frontend side of things once I finished.
Overall, for being one of my first projects to complete, I was really proud of the outcome.
